# Planet Storm

![gameplay](doc/gameplay.gif?raw=true)

Planet Storm was imagined as a 3D, physics-based, side-scrolling platformer inspired by the [1980's IREM classic "Moon Patrol"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol).

For more information and instructions, refer to this blog post: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/we-also-make-games-aws-first-internal-o3de-game-is-now-available/

## Prerequisites

You need to build or [install O3DE engine](https://o3de.org/download/).

You need to [install git with lfs support](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [setup a token on your github account](https://www.docs.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/#configure-credentials-for-git-lfs). Needed as the repository uses Git LFS, the "Download ZIP" button will not download assets.

## How to run

1. Clone the github repository (`git clone https://github.com/o3de/Planet_Storm.git`). When prompted to authenticate, use your github username and the token as password.
2. Launch O3DE. It will open the Project manager. Click on the **New Project** button then **Open Existing Project** option.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository. Open the folder. The project should now be registered.

6. The asset pre-processor will run for a bit. Once it is over you will be welcomed with the **Open a Level** window. Pick the first one.
